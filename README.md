* Cygwin EmacsClient Wrapper

A small batch script to allow me to launch emacs client from outside of a cygwin bash shell. I'm using it with the [It's All Text](https://github.com/docwhat/itsalltext/) plugin in Firefox.

** Usage

1. Copy the cmd file somewhere on your system. Add it to the Windows path. 
2. Launch Emacs in Cygwin and launch the Emacs Server. 
3. Set the It's All Text plugin to call the cmd file and use a path with the Cygwin directory structure as the working directory.
4. It should just work now.
